<h2 id="a-letter-to-all-present-and-future-rss-syncing-platforms">A Letter to all Present and Future RSS Syncing Platforms</h2>

<p>First of congratulations! The shutdown of Google Reader has created the perfect opportunity for you to show off your talents and bring (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/17/good-riddance-google-reader/" title="Good Riddance, Google Reader">some would say</a>, desperately needed) new ideas and innovation to the realm of RSS. We are all very keen to see these ideas come to life. </p>

<p>Right now you are probably preoccupied with pushing releases and keeping servers running smoothly. But I would nonetheless like to call your attention to the following issue: <strong>The lack of consensus, among RSS Syncing Platforms, on a new common API format.</strong></p>

<p>Google Reader was the de facto standard and was thus used as a platform for others to build upon<a href="http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2013/03/the-sad-end-of-google-reader-and-what-it-says-abou.html" title="The Sad End of Google Reader and What it Says About The Music Business">&#x21ac;</a>. With its upcoming shutdown, we are entering a fragmented market of feed-syncing platforms (I count at least half a dozen already). This puts us at the brink of war, e.g. a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Format_war" title="VHS vs. Betamax; HD DVD vs. Blu-ray; RSS vs. ATOM.">format war</a> that, if it breaks out, will 1) take end-users as hostages, 2) discourage other developers from building upon the technology, and 3) erode any progress and innovation you might otherwise be bringing to the table.</p>

<p>A format war would be devastating for the RSS ecosystem. We take it for granted now that content providers put up RSS feeds. But this is not a given. They will only do so long as it&#8217;s worth their effort and it drives traffic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The more people used Reader, the more attractive it was to have an RSS feed and to write posts in feed-friendly ways. And the more people provided RSS content and structured online interactions around the blogs that pass through RSS, the more attractive it became to be a part of that ecosystem. If you then pull away the product at the heart of that system, you end up causing significant disruption … <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/03/utilities" title="Google's Google problem">&#x21ac; Google&#8217;s Google problem</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this when we instead could share a common platform and could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fighting for new users, not just the existing Google Reader users. <em>»Reader is (was?) for information junkies; not just tech nerds. This market totally exists and is weirdly under-served (and is possibly affluent)«</em><a href="https://plus.google.com/101851274707291135260/posts/FipoiXvRaa3" title="Wethrell on Google Reader">&#x21ac;</a> as Chris Wetherell writes.</li>
  <li>Convincing those many still, profoundly unaware of the great benefits of RSS, to come join in and experience. Experience benefits you and I enjoy everday. However it might require a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/13/google-readers-death-is-proof-that-rss-always-suffered-from-lack-of-consumer-appeal/" title="Google Reader’s Death Is Proof That RSS Always Suffered From Lack Of Consumer Appeal">great deal of explaining</a> to give RSS general consumer appeal.</li>
  <li>Competing on creating great products, not on creating lock-ins. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>… one of the main reasons why Google Reader could exist was because companies and entities with completely conflicting agendas came together to support RSS and other standards. Google, MoveableType, Blogger, WordPress, Flickr and several other web apps believed in creating RSS feeds for easy consumption. “In the end it helped the average users,” said Wetherell. <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/13/chris-wetherll-google-reader/" title="Google Reader lived on borrowed time: creator Chris Wetherell reflects">&#x21ac; Google Reader lived on borrowed time</a></p>

  <li><a href="http://blog.bazqux.com/2013/04/open-reader-api.html">Владимир Шабанов</a>: &#8220;We need single open vendor neutral feed-sync API.&#8221;</li>
  <li><a href="http://aviflax.com/post/i-support-the-rss-consensus-on-the-open-reader-api/">Avi Flax</a>: &#8220;I support The RSS Consensus on the Open Reader API because feeds are fantastic and we need a vibrant ecosystem.&#8221;</li>
  <li><a href="https://feedhq.org/blog/3-supporting-google-reader-api">Bruno Renié</a>: &#8220;&#8230;  it is becoming clear that APIs for feed syncing and reading need to be standardized. This would avoid duplicating work for both server and client developers. FeedHQ fully supports the Open Reader API initiative. We&#8217;ll do our best to support the standard which will emerge because we think it&#8217;s best for the end users.&#8221;</li>
